# ChatGPT Micro-Cap Experiment

Welcome to the repository behind my live trading experiment where ChatGPT manages a real-money micro-cap portfolio, now enhanced with a comprehensive **Streamlit Portfolio Management Application**.

## 🎯 The Concept

Starting with just $100, this project answers a simple but powerful question:

**Can large language models like ChatGPT actually generate alpha using real-time market data?**

### Daily Trading Process:
- ChatGPT receives real-time trading data on portfolio holdings
- Strict stop-loss rules and risk management apply  
- Weekly deep research sessions for portfolio reevaluation
- Performance data tracked and published regularly
